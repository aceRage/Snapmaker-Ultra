; WebRTC camera video: go2rtc (bundled, $INSTDIR\resources\tools\go2rtc\go2rtc.exe) carries the
; media straight from this PC to the phone rather than through the hub, so unlike everything else
; the hub runs it needs an inbound port. It takes the first free one in 8555-8574 (RemoteHub.cpp,
; free_webrtc_port), hence the range rather than a single port, and both protocols: UDP is the
; media, TCP is go2rtc's ICE-TCP fallback for networks that drop UDP. Program-bound like the rules
; above, so nothing else on the PC gains a port. Without this rule Windows prompts on go2rtc's
; first bind and writes a *block* rule if the prompt is dismissed - which the hub then has to
; detect and explain (RemoteHub.cpp, firewall_query). Pre-creating it is what stops that.
