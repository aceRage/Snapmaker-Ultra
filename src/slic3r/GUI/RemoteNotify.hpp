// Relay notifications (P5). The hub forwards printer events to a push relay the person picked -
// ntfy, Pushover or a plain webhook - so the phone is told with the page closed and with no
// service worker, no secure context and no manifest. It works for a LAN-only user, because the
// PC is the one making the outbound call, not the phone.
//
// This module lives in the hub process only. It owns the destination list in
// <datadir>/hub/settings.json (the file that survives a clean quit, next to the phone token),
// a worker thread and a queue: deliver() is called from a request thread and must never block
// it, so it appends to the queue and returns.
//
// The topic of an ntfy destination, a Pushover user key or app token and a webhook's header
// value are credentials - an ntfy topic in particular *is* the password, anybody holding it can
// read and publish. So: never logged, always masked to their last 4 characters in anything this
// module hands back, never reachable from the phone origin (/hub/* is loopback + X-Hub-Secret).

// Queued and sent by the worker; returns immediately. Safe to call before configure().

// status, error} with the relay's own HTTP status, so a wrong topic or a dead server is visible
// on the page instead of vanishing into the queue.
