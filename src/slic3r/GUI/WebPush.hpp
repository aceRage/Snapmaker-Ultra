// Web Push (P7). The long-term notification path: the phone page, installed to the home screen
// or open on a secure origin, subscribes to its browser's own push service, and the hub posts
// the event straight to that endpoint. No relay account anywhere - the only third party is the
// push service the browser already picked (Apple, Google, Mozilla), and it never sees the
// payload, because the body is encrypted to a key pair the phone made and only the phone can
// read (RFC 8291, aes128gcm).
//
// Two keys matter here and they are easy to confuse:
//   * the VAPID key pair is the *hub's* identity. It is generated once, stored in
//     <datadir>/hub/settings.json, and its public half goes to the page as
//     applicationServerKey. The private half is a credential: masked everywhere, never served
//     under /r/, never logged.
//   * a subscription's p256dh/auth are the *phone's*. They come from the browser and are only
//     useful together with that phone's endpoint, so they are stored as given and masked on the
//     hub page for tidiness rather than for secrecy.
//
// This module lives in the hub process only. The sender runs on RemoteNotify's worker thread -
// deliver() is called from there, never from a request thread.
