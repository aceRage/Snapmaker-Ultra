# Chameleon Brim + Support Interface Auto-Match — repeatable regression check for:
#   1. Off-mode ("object" brim_filament_source) byte-identity vs the frozen
#      baseline_clean.gcode, AND determinism of two consecutive off-mode slices.
#   2. nearest_wall-mode sanity (exit 0, M620 count within the switch-count
#      guard bound, brim feature present) AND determinism of two consecutive
#      nearest_wall slices.
#   3. (Part 2) Support Interface Auto-Match on the tshape.stl fixture:
#      manual/off-mode support-region identity vs p2_baseline.gcode (tower off/on,
#      plus a v2.6 LEGACY-KEY check that the old "manual" string still resolves
#      to matching DISABLED), and (v2.4 spec A/D, retargeted for v2.6) a
#      LEGACY-KEY check: spike_p2_overrides.json still literally sets
#      support_interface_filament_source = "nearest_surface" - the enum key
#      v2.6 removed entirely (replacing it with the support_filament_matching
#      checkbox) - proving PrintConfigDef::handle_legacy's rename+remap branch
#      (PrintConfig.cpp, folds together the v2.4 "nearest_surface" alias and
#      the v2.6 enum-to-bool migration) migrates it to
#      support_filament_matching = "1" instead of silently substituting the
#      default (matching disabled). Retargeted from this section's pre-v2.4
#      "nearest_surface-mode sanity" checks - see the section's own comment
#      below for exactly what's asserted and why.
#   4. (Part 2, v2.2 Task 4, spec C8; retargeted for v2.6) a SECOND LEGACY-KEY
#      check: spike_p2_wall_overrides.json still literally sets
#      support_interface_filament_source = "nearest_wall" - also removed by
#      v2.6 - proving the same handle_legacy branch migrates THIS old value to
#      support_filament_matching = "1" too (both old non-manual values land on
#      matching ENABLED). Bounded M620 growth + feature-tag presence (tower
#      off/on) plus a determinism repeat round out the group, same sanity bar
#      as section 3's checks. Checks are prefixed "p2-wall-" to avoid
#      colliding with section 2's unrelated "nearestwall-*" (Part 1
#      brim_filament_source=nearest_wall) checks.
#
# Run from anywhere; the script cd's into its own directory (spike/) first so

# Strip lines/fields known (and verified, see Task 4 report) to legitimately

#   - lines starting "; at " (defensive; currently folded into the line above,
#     kept as its own filter in case a future build ever splits it out)
#   - "; brim_filament_source = ..." config-dump line (value differs
#     object vs nearest_wall by design, and is entirely absent from the
#     pre-Task-3 baseline_clean.gcode, which predates that config key)
#   - "; support_interface_filament_source = ..." AND "; support_filament_matching
#     = ..." config-dump lines (Task 2 added the former key after
#     baseline_clean.gcode was recorded in Part 1, so every current slice —
#     including plain object-mode ones with support untouched — dumps one extra
#     CONFIG_BLOCK line baseline_clean.gcode doesn't have; confirmed via Task
#     4's diff investigation to be the *only* diff for the pre-existing Part 1
#     object-mode checks, i.e. a stale-normalize gap from Task 2/3, not a Task
#     4 regression. v2.6 renamed the key to the latter when the enum became a
#     checkbox - but baseline_clean.gcode was re-recorded at some point under
#     the OLD name (it literally contains "; support_interface_filament_source
#     = manual", verified via direct diff), while every current build now
#     emits the NEW name - so BOTH patterns must stay stripped: dropping the
#     old-name line here would silently reintroduce the exact gap this filter
#     exists to close, just flipped to the opposite fixture.)
#   - the "id:<N> copy 0" suffix on "; printing object ..." / "; stop printing
#     object ..." comments — this per-object numeric id is run-to-run
#     nondeterministic (confirmed by back-to-back identical-command runs in
#     Task 4); everything else on those lines, including the stable
#     "unique label id: NN" companion comment, is left untouched.
#   - M73/M73.2 progress-percentage lines — reordered/shifted by
#     time-estimator noise independent of the actual toolpath (see below).
#   - the "; model printing time: ...; total estimated time: ..." and
#     "; estimated first layer printing time ..." header lines, and the
#     "; filament used [mm]"/"; filament used [cm3]" footer lines — these
#     are downstream fallout of time/flow estimation, not toolpath content.
#   - (Task 4, v2.1, item 1b) degenerate solid-infill micro-extrusion
#     blocks, via normalize_strip_slivers.awk. Root cause and rationale:
#     C:\Dev\SnapmakerOrcaSupports\solid_infill_nondeterminism.md — an
#     address-layout knife edge on a degenerate corner sliver (each variant
#     is itself byte-stable; this is NOT a race) occasionally leaves a
#     ~0.3mm zigzag (footprint ~0.09x0.09mm) present in one slice and
#     absent in another, with fallout in the surrounding travel/retract
#     E-values and M73/filament-used lines (handled above). The
#     group_fills area filter (efb7902553) now removes most of these at
#     the source, but this strip is defense-in-depth per the doc's own
#     "Practical consequences" recommendation: strip any extrusion block
#     (consecutive extruding G1s between travel/retract moves) whose XY
#     bbox is < 0.2mm in both dimensions — real geometry is always far
#     larger than that, so this cannot mask an actual regression. MUST run
#     after the M73 strip above: M73 lines are frequently interspersed
#     inside genuine, large extrusions and would otherwise fragment one
#     real block into a spuriously short tail segment.

# 3. Support Interface Auto-Match (Part 2) — tshape.stl fixture.
#
# CAVEAT (Task 3 report, reconfirmed here): tshape.stl's solid-infill
# chaining is run-to-run AND build-to-build non-deterministic in the base
# pipeline, unrelated to this feature — see support_scope()'s comment above.
# Every check below therefore compares only the support-region + toolchange
# content (support_identical), never a raw whole-file diff. That is
# sufficient to prove the new emission block introduces no divergence in the
# region it touches; it is NOT a whole-file determinism claim, and none is
# made here.
#
# CLI LIMITATION (same family as Part 1's precedent, see spike/FINDINGS.md):
# the CLI cannot assign per-object filaments to a plain STL, so tshape.stl —
# a single object — always resolves to exactly one used extruder no matter
# how many filaments are --load-filaments'd. Print::extruders() (Print.cpp)
# reflects real per-object usage, not the loaded-filament-profile count, so
# chameleon_assign_support_interfaces' own top-level guard
# (print.extruders().size() <= 1) returns before doing any work — no per-
# object "Chameleon support match: ..." BOOST_LOG line is ever emitted on
# THIS fixture, in EITHER mode, regardless of whether an alias/migration
# worked correctly. The checks below therefore CANNOT use that log line as
# migration evidence (unlike a real multi-filament GUI plate) - see 3c's own
# comment for what they use instead.
#
# 3a (v2.6): LEGACY-KEY check, "manual" value. spike_support_overrides.json now
# literally sets support_interface_filament_source = "manual" - the option key
# itself v2.6 removed entirely (replaced by the support_filament_matching
# checkbox, PrintConfig.hpp/.cpp) - so this doubles as the "old value -> matching
# DISABLED" leg of the legacy-key proof, on top of its original identity-vs-
# baseline role.
#
# 3c (v2.4 spec A/D, retargeted v2.6): LEGACY-KEY check, "nearest_surface" value.
# spike_p2_overrides.json still literally sets support_interface_filament_source
# = "nearest_surface" - both the enum value (v2.4) and the enum option itself
# (v2.6) are gone - so slicing with it exercises PrintConfigDef::handle_legacy's
# rename+remap branch (folds together the old v2.4 value-remap and the v2.6
# enum-to-bool migration) end to end. Without that branch,
# ConfigOptionEnum<T>::from_string would fail to find "nearest_surface" (the enum
# no longer even exists) and Config.cpp's set_deserialize_raw would silently
# substitute the option's DEFAULT (matching disabled) instead - so "it still
# slices" alone is NOT sufficient proof the migration worked (a silent-disabled
# substitution also slices without error). Three independent, config-level
# signals distinguish the two outcomes (chosen specifically because the CLI
# LIMITATION above rules out the per-object BOOST_LOG line as evidence on this
# fixture):
#   1. exit 0 (baseline: didn't crash/error).
#   2. The load_config_file log line for this fixture reads "no substitutions
#      performed from file spike_p2_overrides.json" - PROVES handle_legacy
#      consumed "nearest_surface" and rewrote it (opt_key AND value) to
#      something the CURRENT config def DOES recognize BEFORE deserialize ever
#      ran, so the later substitution-logging path (Config.cpp
#      set_deserialize_raw, which WOULD log "Found legacy configuration values,
#      substituted...") never triggers. A substitution-logged run means the
#      migration did NOT fire and the value silently fell back to the default
#      (matching disabled).
#   3. The output gcode's CONFIG_BLOCK dump contains the literal line
#      "; support_filament_matching = 1" (GCode.cpp append_full_config,
#      "; <key> = <value>") - the RESOLVED value after migration, under its NEW
#      key. "= 0" (or the key missing entirely) here would mean the migration
#      silently lost the user's intent even if signal 2 above somehow still
#      passed.
# Section 4 below repeats signals 2-3 for the OTHER old non-manual value,
# "nearest_wall" (spike_p2_wall_overrides.json) - both old values must resolve
# to matching ENABLED. Bounded M620 growth + feature-tag presence (the same
